# 👋 Hi, I’m Jade!

> Turning ideas into projects that people can actually use 🚀  

I’m a **software developer** passionate about building functional, user-friendly applications and experiences. Writing clean, thoughtful code is what makes me excited to start the day.

When I’m not in front of a screen, I’m usually exploring **new hobbies**, getting lost in a good book, or finding ways to make life more fun and creative.
